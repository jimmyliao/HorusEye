# The Eye of Horus part1: Image Generation and Watermark Detection with Vertex AI Imagen 3 and SynthID

Please check the blog: [The Eye of Horus part1: Image Generation and Watermark Detection with Vertex AI Imagen 3 and SynthID](https://memo.jimmyliao.net/p/the-eye-of-horus-part1-image-generation)

**Background:**

* **Imagen (Vertex AI):** Google Cloud's Imagen is a powerful text-to-image diffusion model.
* **SynthID:** A technology developed by Google DeepMind that embeds digital watermarks directly into the pixels of an image during its creation.
* **Imagen 3:** The newest iteration of Imagen, offering improved image quality and adherence to prompts.
* **WatermarkVerificationModel:** A model designated to check for the SynthID watermarks.

**Experiment:**

1.  **Image Generation with Imagen 3:**
    * Use Imagen 3 to generate images of the "Eye of Horus" based on specific prompts.
    * Conduct two sets of generation:
        * One set with the SynthID watermark enabled.
        * Another set without the SynthID watermark.
2.  **Watermark Verification with WatermarkVerificationModel:**
    * Take the generated images from both sets.
    * Use the WatermarkVerificationModel to analyze each image and determine if a SynthID watermark is present.
    * Record the results of the verification.

**## What is this**

This experiment demonstrates the application of SynthID's robust watermarking capabilities within the context of AI-generated imagery. It evaluates how effectively SynthID can embed and detect imperceptible watermarks in images produced by Imagen 3, showcasing a method for establishing provenance and authenticity in AI-generated content.

**## Why you should read this**

* **Understanding AI-Generated Content Authenticity:** As AI-generated images become increasingly realistic, it's crucial to have mechanisms for verifying their origin. This experiment provides insights into how SynthID addresses this challenge.
* **Practical Application of SynthID:** This provides a real world example of how to use SynthID with Imagen.
* **Exploring Imagen 3 Capabilities:** Readers can observe the quality of images generated by Imagen 3 and its integration with watermarking technologies.
* **Combating Misinformation:** Watermarking is a key tool in the fight against deepfakes and the spread of manipulated media.

**## What technologies used**

* **Google Cloud Vertex AI:** The platform for accessing and utilizing Imagen and SynthID.
* **Imagen 3:** Google's advanced text-to-image diffusion model.
* **SynthID:** Google DeepMind's imperceptible watermarking technology.
* **WatermarkVerificationModel:** The model used to detect SynthID watermarks.
* **Python (or relevant programming language):** Used to interact with the Vertex AI APIs.

**## How to verify**

To verify the experiment, you can follow these steps:

1.  **Access Vertex AI:** You'll need access to a Google Cloud Platform project with Vertex AI enabled.
2.  **Imagen 3 Generation:**
    * Use the Vertex AI SDK or the Google Cloud console to interact with Imagen 3.
    * Write code or use the console interface to generate "Eye of Horus" images with and without SynthID watermarking.
    * Ensure you have the correct settings to enable/disable SynthID during generation.
3.  **Watermark Verification:**
    * Utilize the WatermarkVerificationModel provided within Vertex AI.
    * Write code to load the generated images and pass them to the verification model.
    * Analyze the model's output to determine the presence or absence of a watermark.
    * Record the results.
4.  **Reproducibility:**
    * Document your prompts, code, and settings to ensure reproducibility.
    * Compare your results with the expected outcomes (watermarks detected in the corresponding set).
5.  **Visual Inspection:**
    * Visually inspect the generated images. Confirm that there is no obvious visual difference between the watermarked and non-watermarked images.
6.  **Statistical Analysis (Optional):**
    * If you generate a large number of images, perform statistical analysis to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the watermark detection.

By following these steps, you can independently verify the effectiveness of SynthID in watermarking images generated by Imagen 3.
